## Transformer-Based Text Adventure Agents Research Project

This project focuses on investigating the performance of Transformer-based AI models within a text-based game environment. We explore and analyze the ability of these models to understand, interact with, produce logical strategies, and effectively operate within narratives presented by text-based games.
### Research Study Areas

The goal of the research is to dissect and comprehend the capacity of transformer models to discern and handle various complex narrative facets. We have identified two primary areas of investigation for this project:
1. **Depth of Understanding Analysis:** 
   We aim to assess the AI's ability to understand a game's narrative, plot twists, and characters at different complexity levels. By using games rich in narrative elements such as backstories, conflicts, and motives, we put the AI's understanding into test. We delve into whether the AI can comprehend direct gameplay actions, underlying motivations, language nuances, moral and ethical decisions, and empathetic reasoning, among other aspects.
2. **Non-monotonic Reasoning Investigation:**
    Here, we scrutinize the AI's ability to navigate through complex logic issues. We use games that require advanced reasoning, dealing with paradoxes, or handling self-referential and circular situations. We focus on the AIâ€™s aptitude to handle logical dilemmas, predict long-term outcomes and contradictions.
Together, these topics serve as the basis for a rich and expansive evaluation of Transformer-based AI models within text-based game environments.
