## Misalignment in Transformer-Based Text Adventure Agents

In this paper we are going to do some research on how transformer performs while playing and training in a text based game environment.


## Research Ideas

### 1. Depth of Understanding Analysis: 

The game could be designed to be rich in narrative, including complex characters, intricate plotlines, and nuanced themes. By coding the game to have multiple layers of meaning and a variety of ways in which the player can interact with the game world, we can analyze the AI's understanding at varying levels of depth.
The AI should be able to understand not just direct gameplay interactions (picking up item X, going to location Y), but also the motivations and implications underneath those actions. 
Examples:
For instance, in a scenario where a character lies or withholds information, will the AI understand the character's motive even if not spelled out explicitly or directly? Can the AI read between the lines and understand subtext within dialogues? Will it grasp more or evolved moral messages? Some key capabilities to examine here could be the understanding of language nuances, comprehension of complex emotional contexts, understanding of moral and ethical decisions in the game, and empathetic reasoning.

### 2. Non-monotonic Reasoning:

The game for this could involve situations that require logic jumps or dealing with paradoxes, self-reference or circular reasoning. This is a challenging task since it requires an advanced level of logic and understanding of contradictions.
Let's take an example, suppose there's a game character who always tells lies. The character makes a statement: "I am lying now." If the statement is true, then the character is lying, which would mean the statement is false. But if the statement is false, then the character is telling the truth, which contradicts the premise that the character always lies. Can the AI handle this paradox?
Moreover, the game could have choices that appear beneficial in the short term but have adverse long-term consequences, requiring the AI to anticipate these consequences. Evaluation in this case could focus on the AI's ability to reason through complex logical dilemmas, to predict long-term outcomes, and to effectively handle paradoxical or contradictory information. 
These games are sure to challenge both the AI's cognitive and emotional understanding while providing tangible parameters for evaluating their capacities.

Games to play:
1. [Maybe] "A Dark Room": This game starts simply but eventually reveals a deeper narrative with implicit information about the world and its history, which could be ideal for testing depth of understanding.

2. [ ]"Anchorhead": This Lovecraftian adventure game could be suitable for non-monotonic reasoning due to its suspense-filled, ever-evolving narrative.
3. [X] "Galatea": This game is a fascinating dialogue-based interaction with an artificial intelligence, consisting of a deeply branching conversation tree. It could be used to evaluate the AI's understanding of characters' emotions and motivations. 
4. [ ]"Varicella": A game that's renowned for its complex characters and intricate plotting. It's known to be difficult, ambiguous, and to involve a significant amount of moral reasoning. 
5. [ ]"Lost Pig": This game is based on quirky logic and could be adapted to involve more paradoxes or non-monotonic reasoning scenarios.
6. [ ] Emily Shortâ€™s "Counterfeit Monkey": This game involves a wide range of linguistic puzzles and word-related challenges to evaluate in-depth language understanding.
